Itetrative Programming
   choose variable that 'count'
   initialize outside the loop
   set up end test(includes variable to check it)
   construct block(set of instructions - change the variable)
   what to do when done

Tuple - ordered sequence of elements(immutable:cannot change)
ex) too=(1,2,3,4)
 selection too[1]
 slicing too[2:] [starting point:end point minus 1 ]

Decomposition and Abstracting

Functions
  making a new primitive
  formal structure of function
  def name(variable):
      code
      return Value(when nothing, use None)
local binding of variable in a function does not effect global binding
raw_input("message") -> to get a input 

"""explanation about the function***

Recurrsion
 inductive step - breakdown the program in to a simpler problem with same form
 Palindrome program

Numbers in python
integer
arbitrarily long integer
float - resembling real numbers

python rounds number (in binary) at the 17th digit -> making slight errors.
worry about == when using float
ex) sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)==2 is false
there for writing library like abs(x-y)<epsilon(sufficiently small number to say they are equal) will be a great help

Using assert can really help 
ex) assert x>=0, <string>

Non-Scalar - Tuples
             Strings
they are immutable

mutable type - List
<somelist>.append(element of <somelist>)
<somelist>.remove(element of <somelist>)
